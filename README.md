# gitworkflow

I created gitworkflow repo from the LocalList Organization. 
Then I forked the gitworkflow repo.
Then I cloned that repo to my local machine (pairing station). 
Then I added these changes to this readme file. 
Then I saved the changes and committed them as Test1.  
Then I made some more changes and saved them. 
Then I committed the other changes as Test2. 
Then I switched to the 'dev' branch by typing git checkout -b dev
Then I made some more changes and saved them (lines 10-12).
Then I committed the changes.
